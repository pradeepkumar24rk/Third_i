It is possible to say that 60% of the blindness in the world can be cured, and 20% can be prevented. Looking at the age range, it can be said that 60% of the visually impaired are aged 65 and over, and there are 19 million visually impaired children. Our project is specially created for the visually impaired persons and blind persons, for whom it can act as a third eye, that is why it is named as “Third i”."

    desc:"The “Third i” project makes the visually impaired persons to feel like a normal person. Visually impaired assistance using object, distance, and face detection is an innovative project designed to provide assistance to visually impaired people. it utilizes facial recognition to help people identify their friends and relatives, as well as object detection with distance estimation to detect harmful objects that may be approaching them. if a person carrying the object is unknown to the visually impaired, they will be issued a warning. this project provides an extra layer of safety and security for those with visual impairments, and also provides them with the means to identify familiar faces. it is a revolutionary way to help the visual impairments to navigate their environment safely and independently."

    title:"APPLICATION",
    desc:"The application is designed to be easy to use, requiring only camera access to work. Users simply need to open the app, and it will capture their surrounding video. The app utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to recognize objects in each frame of the video. Once the app detects an obstacle or person in the user's path, it immediately sends a voice message to the user to help them navigate their environment safely. The app can be used in any setting, making it perfect for navigating unfamiliar environments and based on the user preference SOS feature will be triggered. The development team behind Visually Impaired Assistance Using Object, Distance, And Face Detection provides a solution that empowers visually impaired individuals to live independent and fulfilling lives. The app's user-friendly interface and advanced features make it a game-changer for the visually impaired community."
